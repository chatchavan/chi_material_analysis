The script is considered to be in this category.)	Includes: Technology probes and cultural probes that are custom-made by the authors	Example: In a Fitts’s law study of movement time and index of difficulties, the following materials are in this category: (1) the software that presents targets and capture the cursor movements and (2) the list of height and width of the targets.
